# Planned Language/Interpreter Enhancements
- [ ] Implement `X` (Execute string as psPILOT instruction)
- [ ] Implement `XS` (Execute string as system (PowerShell) command)

# Planned psPILOT Scripts
- [ ] psPILOT REPL (requires `X`)

# Possible future ideas
- Sound, MS BASIC MML? (need equivalent of Console::Beep in PowerShell Core)
