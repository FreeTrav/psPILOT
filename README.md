# psPILOT
psPILOT is an implementation of the PILOT programming language (**P**rogrammed **I**nstruction, **L**earning, **O**r **T**eaching) written entirely in Microsoft's PowerShell scripting language. It implements most of the PILOT Core language as defined in the (now withdrawn) IEEE standard 1154 of 1991 (Corrected to November 1991). For historical information on and an overview of the language, the reader is referred to [Wikipedia's page on the PILOT language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PILOT).

This implementation has been tested using PowerShell 5 on Windows 7 and PowerShell 6 on Linux Mint, but it should work without issue on any PowerShell 5 or later system, and quite likely on any PowerShell 3 or later system.

**psPILOT.md** is the language description.
